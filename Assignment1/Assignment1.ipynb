In Python's chess module, each tile has an integer id corresponding to it, where `'A1' = 0`, `'A2' = 1`, etc, and they are really just treated as integers by the chess module. Each chess square is equivalent to a number ranging from `0` to `63`, going from left to right, one row at at a time.\n",

    "For example, the knight starting on tile `'A1' = 0` and moving through tiles `'A1' = 0`, `'B3' = 17`, and `'D2' = 11`, in that order, before finally reaching the destination `'F1' = 5` would be represented by the list `[0, 17, 11, 5]`. Please note, this conversion from `A1` to `0` happens automatically, so please just don't be confused if you added a chess Tile to your list and saw it as an integer when you print it out; it is really the same thing.\n",
